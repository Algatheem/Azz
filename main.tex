Today I going to talk about the LaTex seminar with some examples .....

The present paper provides a comparison between the numerical method in the linear regime and \textbf{simulation} methods in
the non-linear regime, in the presence of a vertical \textit{magnetic field}.\\


\textcolor{red}{There is a fair agreement between the two methods leads to a high rate of suppression of \underline{fluid} flow by the vertical magnetic field. According to the results of the analytical method, the given eigenvalues of the growth rate can be resolved numerically}.\\


\textcolor{green}{According to the results of the analytical method, the given eigenvalues of the growth rate can be resolved numerically}\huge of the analytical method, the given eigenvalues of the growth rate can be resolved numerically.\normalsize According to the results of the analytical method, the given eigenvalues of the growth rate can be resolved numerically
